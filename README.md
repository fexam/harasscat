Lasers and cats and VR and stuff! (For HackRPI 2014)
This project uses a laser pointer on a swivel base (controlled by an arduino) to play with your cat. 
A kinect watches this play
The user may watch thru a web interface and control the laser.
Hopefully, the kinect + machine vision will allow a computer to play with the cat algorithmically.
